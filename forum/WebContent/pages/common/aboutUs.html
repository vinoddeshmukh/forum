					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Struts 2</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time. Apache Struts 2 was originally known as WebWork 2.

This tutorial will teach you how to use Apache Struts for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications in simple and easy steps.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>JSF</strong></a><strong> : </strong>JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces. JavaServer Faces is a standardized display technology which was formalized in a specification through the Java Community Process.
This tutorial will teach you basic JSF concepts and will also take you through various advance concepts related to JSF framework.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Spring MVC</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Spring framework is an open source Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and very rapidly.
Spring framework was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.
This tutorial has been written based on Spring Framework version 3.1.0 released in Dec 2011.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Wicket</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Apache Wicket is a simple and features rich component-based web framework, the real reusable components is the main selling point of this framework. However, due to the big different between component-based and MVC architecture, it makes Wicket hard to learn, especially for those classic MVC developers.
In this tutorials, it providing many step by step examples and explanations on using Apache Wicket 1.4.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Stripes</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Stripes is a presentation framework for building web applications using the latest Java technologies. The main driver behind Stripes is that web application development in Java is just too much work! It seems like every existing framework requires gobs of configuration. Struts is pretty feature-light and has some serious architectural issues (see Stripes vs. Struts for details). Others, like WebWork 2 and Spring-MVC are much better, but still require a lot of configuration, and seem to require you to learn a whole new language just to get started.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Tapestry</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Apache Tapestry is an open-source framework for creating dynamic, robust, highly scalable web applications in Java. Tapestry complements and builds upon the standard Java Servlet API, and so it works in any servlet container or application server.</div>
				
					<div class="row"><a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>RIFE</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Full-stack open-source component framework to quickly and consistently develop and maintain Java web applications</div>
				
					<div class="row"><a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Seam</strong></a><strong> : </strong>Seam provides a number of example applications demonstrating how to use the various features of Seam. This tutorial will guide you through a few of those examples to help you get started learning Seam. The Seam examples are located in the examples subdirectory of the Seam distribution. The registration example, which will be the first example we look at, is in the examples/registration directory.

Each example has the same directory structure:

The view directory contains view-related files such as web page templates, images and stylesheets.
The resources directory contains deployment descriptors and other configuration files.
The src directory contains the application source code.
The example applications run both on JBoss AS and Tomcat with no additional configuration. The following sections will explain the procedure in both cases. Note that all the examples are built and run from the Ant build.xml, so you'll need a recent version of Ant installed before you get started.</div>
				
					<div class="row">  <a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</strong></a><strong> : </strong>The Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a toolkit to develop Ajax web application with Java. The programmer writes Java code and this code is translated into HTML and Javascript via the GWT compiler.

The compiler creates browser specific HTML and JavaScript to support all the major browsers correctly. GWT supports a standard set of UI widgets, has build in support for the browser back button and a JUnit based test framework.

GWT provides two modes

Development Mode: allows to debug the Java code of your application directly via the standard Java debugger.

Web mode: the application is translated into HTML and Javascript code and can be deployed to a web server.</div>
				
					<div class="row"><a class="inline cboxElement" href="valueDetails" title="" rel=""><strong>OpenXava</strong></a><strong> : </strong>OpenXava is an AJAX Java Framework for Rapid Development of Enterprise Web Applications.

In OpenXava you only have to write the domain classes in plain Java to get a web application ready for production.</div>
